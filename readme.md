# A Laravel/Ajax Web Application

The Pionear web application is a Laravel-based web application for home gardeners.

Laravel is used to create a user login system and as a tool for creating CRUD functionality for the website app's database.

Javscript is used to handle the user's garden inputs and to build a JSON object that is then passed to the Laravel backend using an AJAX post request.

Examples of PHP and mySQL code can be found in 'app/Http/Controllers'.
